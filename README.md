# Event Registration and Ticket Management System


The *Event Registration and Ticket Management System* is a Java Swing application that allows users to view upcoming events, register for them, and receive tickets. Event organizers can create and manage events, set seat limits, and view attendee information, while administrators have full control over users, events, and reports. The system uses a database to store event and user data, supports role-based login, tracks seat availability, prevents overbooking, and generates tickets with unique IDs. It also provides basic reports, notifications, and error handling for a smooth and reliable user experience.
